YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using MongoDB, MySQL and Streamlit


**Project Description:**
YouTube is an online social media platform where videos of different kinds are shared among common people. Getting data from any website is known as web scraping. Here, data was scraped from YouTube using a YouTube API key with the help of Python. The collected details included information about random channels, their playlists, videos, and comments. This data was then stored in a MongoDB database, as the scraped data is semi-structured. Subsequently, this data was processed into a proper structured format and then stored in MySQL database in a tabular format. To analyze the derived data, SQL queries were written and executed against the database. Finally, all these steps were presented as output through an open-source web application called Streamlit. The entire process is divided into three parts: Data Scraping, Data Migration, and Data Querying.

**Purpose of the Project:**
YouTube is one of the most frequently used online media platforms, and the number of YouTube video creators and consumers is increasing day by day. This project can be valuable for YouTube channel owners to analyze basic information about their channel and compare it with other content creators. The aim of this comparison is to encourage growth, not destruction.

**Personal Opinion:**
This is my first programming project, and it has benefited greatly from input from various people, including myself. Through this project, I have learned more about Python, MongoDB, MySQL, and especially, the Streamlit web application.
